# Job Search Aid
This Android application aids jobs seekers by providing resources such as FAQs, resume templates, and interview tips. Coupled with that, users can dynamically fetch jobs within a maximum radius of 100 miles based on the location entered and career field desired. As long as a user has created an account and is signed in, they can save jobs and view their saved jobs under their profile information where they have the ability to delete saved jobs.
